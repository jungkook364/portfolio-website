        <div class="explain">
            <p>I am a final-year Computer Science Engineering student with a strong foundation in software
                development and a passion for building practical, user-focused applications. Currently gaining
                hands-on experience as a Python Full Stack Development Intern, I work across the complete
                development lifecycle—from backend logic to database management and frontend interfaces.</p> 


            <p> My technical toolkit spans Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, complemented by experience with
                development tools like Git, VS Code, and MySQL Workbench. I am particularly interested in building
                reliable, scalable solutions and continuously expanding my knowledge in emerging technologies
                including cloud computing and AI fundamentals.</p> <br>
